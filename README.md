Quake Enhanced Mod for 1-6 players.

Cranked is a Quake Mod by Patrick Martin released in 1998, it makes some changes to the monsters giving them new abilities such as new spells / attacks.

Nightmare+ is a Mod by JPiolho released in 2021 that provides options such as:

- Increase the amount of monsters by way of multiplier eg. x3.

- Increase monster health

- Increase ammo amounts

- Respawn items: ammo, health, armour.

- Carry over found items over such as keys & weapons.

This combines both mods & also tries to provide a better overall balance & adds other optional features such as Double Jump mod by Teamred.

Also see cranked Nightmare+.txt for more info, the file also contains the original Nightmare_Plus readme contents at the end.
